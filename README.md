# 🌠 STAR WARS WEBPAGE 👩‍🚀 / SPRINT 8


## About The Project

Excellent exercise based on REACT JS. This is a WebPage emulating and honoring Star Wars World of George Lucas where you can find 
several starships and their features from the movies and if you like'd to, login in. 
Here you can find the route for 2 pages(home & starships) and the very particular bottons which simulate the legendary lightsabers of the films .
